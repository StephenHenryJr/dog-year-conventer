# dog-year-conventer
A simple JS exercise creating a function that converts human years to dog years

A beginner exercise from Codecademy.
A function is built in which converts our age to dog years.

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

Otherwise I will be using TailwindCSS to style the page since there is not much to it.
